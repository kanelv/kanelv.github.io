## Side Projects & Interests

In my spare time, I enjoy building hands-on projects that explore different technologies and architectural patterns:

- **[URL Shortener API](https://github.com/kanelv/url-shortener)** - A full-featured URL shortening service built with NestJS, TypeScript, and a dual-database strategy (PostgreSQL + DynamoDB). Features Clean Architecture, role-based access control, automatic link expiration, and click analytics. A great exploration of API design and scalability.

- **[Library Management System](https://github.com/kanelv/LibraryManagementAPI)** - A production-grade REST API built with Java 17, Spring Boot 3, and PostgreSQL. Demonstrates Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture principles with comprehensive authentication, borrowing workflows, and penalty calculation.

- **[Quick OTP](https://github.com/kanelv/quick-otp)** - A lightweight Chrome extension for managing TOTP-based two-factor authentication. Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite. Features multiple QR scanning methods, real-time countdown, and import/export functionality.

## Publications & Talks

- **An Extended Agent-Based Mechanism For Testing Service Function Chain** (October 2020)
  Conference presentation on innovative system testing approaches
