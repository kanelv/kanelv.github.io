# About Me

Hey there! I'm **Le Van Cuong**, a passionate software engineer from Da Nang, Vietnam, currently working remotely for a Japan's company.
With a strong foundation in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and microservices, I love building scalable, efficient systems that solve real-world problems.

## My Journey

I hold a **Master’s in Information and Communication Technology** from Soongsil University in Seoul, South Korea (GPA: 4.18/4.50), and a **Bachelor’s in Information Technology** from Danang University of Science and Technology (GPA: 3.2/4.0). My career kicked off as a Research Assistant in Seoul, diving into cutting-edge topics like network functions virtualization and container orchestration. Since then, I’ve worked with innovative companies like **Grid Solutions, Inc.** and **XB Technology Co., Ltd.**, where I’ve designed and deployed everything from energy management systems to e-commerce platforms for UAV delivery.

Currently, I’m a **Software Development Engineer** at Grid Solutions, Inc., crafting microservices with tools like Nest.JS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL, while leveraging AWS and Serverless Framework for scalable deployments. I’ve also had my hands deep in NFT integrations and distributed energy systems—pretty cool stuff, right?

## What I Do

I’m a polyglot programmer fluent in **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **Java/Scala**, and **Python**, with a toolkit that includes frameworks like **Node.js**, **React**, and **Play Framework**. I’m all about **microservice architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and cloud solutions with **AWS** and **Docker**. Whether it’s building APIs, optimizing databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB, or automating deployments with CircleCI, I thrive on creating systems that are robust and maintainable.

## Side Projects & Interests

In my spare time, I enjoy diving into hands-on projects like my **[URL Shortener](https://github.com/kanelv/url-shortener)**, a service I built using Nest.JS, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. It’s a simple yet practical tool that creates short aliases for long URLs, redirecting users seamlessly to the original link—a fun way to explore API design and scalability.

I’m also proud of my contributions to the tech community, like my presentation at a conference in October 2020 titled *An Extended Agent-Based Mechanism For Testing Service Function Chain*. It was a deep dive into innovative system testing—pretty rewarding to share with peers! Beyond coding, I’m fascinated by emerging tech like cloud-native solutions, microservices, and the evolving world of DevOps, which keep me inspired and curious.
